/*
SQL Normalization

1NF
Each record in a table must be uniquely identifiable
Each cell / column should contain a single value

2NF
Be in 1NF
No partial dependencies
AKA Single Column Primary Key that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation

3NF
Be in 2NF
No transient dependencies
Should be no non-key attributes (attributes that are not part of the primary key) depending on other non-key attributes

BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
Even when a database is in 3rd Normal Form, still there would be anomalies resulting if it has more than one Candidate Key.

4NF (Fourth Normal Form) Rules
If no database table instance contains two or more, independent and multivalued data describing the relevant entity, then it is in 4th Normal Form.

5NF (Fifth Normal Form) Rules
A table is in 5th Normal Form only if it is in 4NF and it cannot be decomposed into any number of smaller tables without loss of data.

6NF (Sixth Normal Form) Proposed
6th Normal Form is not standardized, yet however, it is being discussed by database experts for some time. Hopefully, we would have a clear & standardized definition for 6th Normal Form in the near futureâ€¦
